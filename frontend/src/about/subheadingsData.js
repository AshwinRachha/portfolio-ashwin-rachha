            <p>
            I am a Master's student majoring in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I have a passion for building, scaling, maintaining and perusing about intelligent systems that have sprung from the fields of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and principles of Software Engineering with their presence in real-world settings. 

My most recent experience was a wonderful internship experience at Outreach Corporation where I was responsible for building a template engine project that could ease the process of Deploying NLP based models online for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. During this experience I learned how to build and configure a complex Inference Service Solution (NVIDIA Triton Inference Server) for deploying Model Binaries for BERT, ROBERTA and DistilBERT in their ONNX flavor. I also wrote a Golang Based Microservice which would be used to communicate with the configured server and would server prediction results in real-time. Finally to test the working of the project I wrote tests in CircleCI configs and dockerized the inference solution as well as the microservice into a container and deployed it online via Kubernetes manifests. Being in a close knit environment with great leaders and programmers was the best highlight of my internship. This experience evolved my thinking about designing and deploying systems at scale . It also goes without saying that I had an opportunity to add a lot of technologies to my belt ranging from Golang, CircleCI, Kubernetes, Docker, Bash scripting, Python scripting and Software Engineering tools such as Git, Github, JIRA, Confluence etc. 

I love writing about and elucidating Machine Learning and Deep learning concepts and code, it sort of acts as a mental note to myself and as a result I blog regularly @ https://ashwinrachha.github.io/blogpost/ and https://medium.com/@ashwin_rachha/ . I am a Kaggle Notebooks experts and enjoy writing code related to Data Science, NLP and CV competitions. Please checkout my kaggle profile @ https://www.kaggle.com/ashwinrachha1. Alternatively I love solving Data Structures and Algorithms related problems and frequenty blog about them. Checkout my Leetcode profile @ https://leetcode.com/ashwin_rachha/

I am open for Full time opportunities in Machine Learning and or Software Development starting in the summer of 2023. Please feel free to reach out to me regarding any opportunity or for collaborations or just for the sake of reaching out :D.
